description: The Start of Ze New
---

I began this project almost a month ago, with not much of an intention or any high-level goal.
The prime directive for this project is to allow my ideas to be expressed to a wider audience.

Essentially learning in public.

Let's get this straight. Yeah, I can do frontend - but that does not mean
I want to spend the remaining waking hours of my life doing it. The real kick I get from doing this is to build
something really beautiful (must be something to do with my love for art when I was young). But beyond that, my
soul is yearning for something else.

Nevertheless, this blog marks the end of one chapter and the start of another.

And I must say, I outdid myself this time...
