description: The Start of Ze New
---

I began this project almost a month ago, with not much of an intention or any high level goal.
The prime directive for this project is to allow my ideas to be express to a wider audience.

Esentially learning in public.

Let's get this straight. Yeah, I can do frontend - but that does not mean
I actually want to spend my remaining waking hours of my life doing it. The real kick I get
from doing this is to build something really beautiful (must be something to do with my love
for Art when I was young). But beyond that, my soul is yearning for something else.

Nevertheless, this blog marks the end of one chapter and the start of another.

And I must say, I really outdone myself this time...
