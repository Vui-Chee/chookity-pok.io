description: Can we lead sane lives in an imperfect world?
---

Today I want to discuss the ideas of wabi-sabi and how it can help us (hopefully)
lead better lives without becoming bogged down by disappointment when events do not
turn out the way we expect them to.

Who the f*** am I to talk about these things? Am I qualified? Well, I leave that to the reader of
this article to decide. You decide if the words on this page can benefit you or not.

Well at least one thing is for sure, I have my fair share of disappointments in life.

## What is Wabi-Sabi?

wabi-sabi is **a worldview that rejects the pursuit of perfection**. 
It sees the continuous chase of perfection as means without end.

It teaches us to accept existence as it is. *Perfectly imperfect*.

Imagine for a moment you were holding a cup, but it is filled to the brim. 
Now try walking with the cup. You will find it difficult to move without spilling a drop.

It is much easier to walk with just an empty cup.

Very often, people carry a lot of expectations and judgments about the world. 
Their state of contentment is usually derived from the external world, through money, status, or physical possessions.

The real problem with this is that the real world is often beyond our control. And if we expect something
very highly, and do not receive the thing we have wanted, it can often lead to a deep sense of lack or unfulfillment.

## Pursuing Perfection

The ongoing sense of lack is often accompanied when we continuously chase after perfection. After reaching
a certain point of success, there is an underlying yearning that something is missing. Most will even attempt
to fill the void by obtaining more physical manifestations, only to realize that those things will only bring 
short-term satisfaction.

*Aging, crookedness, assymetry, damaged, decay and death* are part of the world we live in. Death especially is an
inescable part of our lives and no matter how hard we try to fight it, eventually time will win and erase all of our existence.
Needless to say, most of everything we do or accomplish pales in comparison to the scale to the universe. Ultimately, very little of what
we do is actually remembered by history. *And yet we persist...*

I am not saying that we should not keep improving ourselves, but maybe we should give ourselves reachable goals. Goals
that do not require us to sacrifice a left nut in order to attain it.

Instead, we can focus on making 1% improvements everyday. Overtime, this smaller but achievable goals will accrue into
bigger ones.

### Seeing Beauty in Imperfection

Whether you have made it or not, I firmly believe we can learn to see things in a way that allows us to appreciate
each other, even when we are equally flawed. We can teach ourselves that each sentient being on this planet has good
qualities in them, and in turn, hopefully, breach the separation so prevalent in the modern world.

## When Good Enough is Good Enough

*wabi-sabi is the acceptance of how things are, and not how they should be.*

Only when we accept that within certain grounds, for the things that are out of our influence, we
let go of the *"clinging"* where lies at the root of our suffering.

And only when do we realise that we are causing our own suffering, do we then become free.
